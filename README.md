# Project Overview
This project is an enhanced version of a simple task management application. It allows users to manage tasks effectively by providing features such as task creation, updating, and deletion, along with user authentication, priority levels, and role-based access control for both users and admins. The application also includes a more polished user interface with improved user experience and defensive programming techniques to ensure robust error handling and secure access.
